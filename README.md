# Mask-R-CNN-with-OpenCV-for-Object-Detection
The real-world scenarios have a lot of applications based on object detection. For example, object detection models are used in self-driving cars to recognize where the pedestrians are, where the are vehicles located, where the signals are, etc in the given frame of view. So, it is very important to develop an understanding of how to use a pre-trained object detection model so that we could later customize it based on our needs.
